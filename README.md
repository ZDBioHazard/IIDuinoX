IIDuinoX
========

IIDuinoX is a simple open-source implementation of a
Beatmania IIDX controller based on Arduino and USB HID.

All that is needed is some appropriate arcade buttons, a USB-capable Arduino
and an encoder system for the turntable -- I repurposed a DJ Hero turntable.

More detailed construction information might appear here someday,
after I build a better unit than my prototype. :)
